# Multivalidator testnet setup notes

It is necessary to wait for the deployment of the initial node before building the image of the following nodes.
Here is a list of things that can only be known after the first image is built/deployed.

- RPC address may be known in advance if that address will be pointed toward the new node evenetually
- the persistent peer node id name (requires /root/.duality/config/node_key.json, i.e. `dualityd init` to be run first)
- the persistent peer IPV4 address (not known until AWS )
- the new genesis file to use that was created in the initial nodes startup script process
- the new mnemonic that was generated by the new gentx actions before the chain started
- the docker image of the followers: can only be made after the chain.json, and genesis.json are updated

## What could be improved

### What could be improved about the Docker setup

Currently, 2 Docker builds+images are needed. This seems unnecessary.
The main reason for this is that the genesis file needs to be updated,
and the persistent peer ID and location need to be update.
- its possible to pre-make the genesis file in an image (so it can become a Docker dependency)
- its possible to determine the node id in an image (so it can become a Docker dependency)
- however it is not always possible to know the IP addresses to the initial node before it is deployed
  - this could be overcome by using AWS Elastic IP addresses and re-assigning them as needed or
    using long-lived load balancer IPs that redirect to new instances after they update (as happens in ECS service ALBs)

Common ------------------> common ----------------------------------> dualityd init --> initial nodes
        |                                                  |     |
        --> dualityd init --> compute configs into files --       --> dualityd init --> follower nodes
