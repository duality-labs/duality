# Multivalidator testnet setup notes

It is necessary to wait for the deployment of the initial node before building the image of the following nodes.
Here is a list of things that can only be known after the first image is built/deployed.

- RPC address may be known in advance if that address will be pointed toward the new node evenetually
- the persistent peer node id name (requires /root/.duality/config/node_key.json, i.e. `dualityd init` to be run first)
- the persistent peer IPV4 address (not known until AWS )
- the new genesis file to use that was created in the initial nodes startup script process
- the new mnemonic that was generated by the new gentx actions before the chain started
- the docker image of the followers: can only be made after the chain.json, and genesis.json are updated
